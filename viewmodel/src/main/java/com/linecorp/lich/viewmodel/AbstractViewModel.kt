/**
 * The base class of ViewModels.
 *
 * This class can be used in almost the same way as Android Architecture Components' ViewModel
 * [androidx.lifecycle.ViewModel], but instances of this ViewModel should be created via
 * [ViewModelFactory]. For details, please refer the document of [ViewModelFactory].
 *
 * This class also implements [CoroutineScope]. This scope has [kotlinx.coroutines.SupervisorJob]
 * and [kotlinx.coroutines.Dispatchers.Main] context elements, and is cancelled just before
 * [onCleared] is called. This is almost equivalent to Android Architecture Components' `viewModelScope`
 * (cf. https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/coroutines#viewmodelscope ),
 * but you can simply write `launch { ... }` instead of `viewModelScope.launch { ... }`.
